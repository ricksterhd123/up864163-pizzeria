# Designs encountered:
## Client-server MVC model:
Using express-generator from before, I really like their MVC model scaffolding.
This allowed me to make my routes behave as a 'controller' which could manipulate the models (i.e. the data stored) on the server.
I felt that using a template system was much easier than using pure HTML since I could pass data into the template before it got rendered by the server, such as
my basket class which contained items stored, and the total price. It allowed me to use inheritance so that I didn't have to repeat myself (as often) as I would when using just HTML.

## Basket system
Creating a basket system from scratch taught me how to integrate both the client and server side and the API layer properly, given more time I would've had more functionality
and features comparable to many simple ecommerce websites.

## Express-session
Storing data per-session taught me a little bit about how user sessions worked and how they can be used to achieve many features which I thought would be out of scope for this project.

## HTML and CSS
It made me realise how the simple things can make the biggest different to the style of a webpage, for instance, simply changing the font makes a big impact to the look and feel.
Also it made me realise just how little I know about CSS, HTML and javascript and how I should take the time to strengthen my frontend web development skills.
